This repository is for the Toolbox version of the Nkonya Dictionary.
Nkonya is a language spoken in the Volta Region of Eastern Ghana.
See http://http://nkonya.wycliffe.ca/ for details.
Formatted versions of the dictionary are periodically posted there.

The following program files are used but not included in the repository:

* Scripts\busybox.exe is available from the link on https://github.com/pclouds/busybox-w32
* Settings\toolbox.exe is available from links on http://sil.org/computing/toolbox/downloads.htm
** for Linux the link on http://sil.org/computing/toolbox/test.htm is better.

Some of the scripts require the perl program to be installed on your system.
This is included in Linux. On Windows, you can install a free version from
http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads
You should use a version newer than v5.12 to get good Unicode support.
