## This Version of the Nkonya Dictionary is Outdated
In 2017, the Nkonya dictionary was converted from Toolbox to the SIL Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx).
The Toolbox version of the dictionary was frozen in September 2017.
All future work on the dictionary will be done using FLEx.
Updates to the FLEx version are posted to https://webonary.org/nkonya
