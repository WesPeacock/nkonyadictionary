This repository is for the Toolbox version of the Nkonya Dictionary.
Nkonya is a language spoken in the Volta Region of Eastern Ghana.
See http://http://nkonya.wycliffe.ca/Dictionary/ for details.
Formatted versions of the dictionary are occasionally posted there.

The main lexical file is Nkolex in Unicode.txt in this directory.
The main Toolbox project file is Toolbox Project.prj in Settings directory.
The control files assume that this directory is C:\My Toolbox Projects\Nkonya.

The following program files are used but not included in the repository:

* Settings\toolbox.exe is available from links on http://sil.org/computing/toolbox/downloads.htm.
* Lexique Pro is available from http://www.lexiquepro.com/download.htm

Some of the scripts require the perl program to be installed on your system.
This is included in Linux. On Windows, you can install a free version from
http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads
You should use a version newer than v5.12 to get good Unicode support.

There's also a single python script. There's a Windows python at http://www.activestate.com/activepython
