====== Subentry Handling Notes ======

Created Tuesday 15 November 2016

===== Multiple Run of hackFWvariants =====
The hack script is run multiple times swapping out the active ini section.
The [hackFWvariants] section has been duplicated with appropriate tags for each run.
The infilename and outfilename are modified so that each run feeds the next run.
Then the hack is run multiple times with different sections
i.e. change [hackFWvariants1] -> [hackFWvariants] and run hack
	   change [hackFWvariants2] -> [hackFWvariants] and run hack



===== Pseudocode for hacking Variants in FW project =====

=== Why? ===
The current FieldWorks (v 8.3.x) SFM import assumes that all references at the sense level to other entries, are to variants, not to complex forms (subentries). This process allows you to make some of them refer to complex forms.

=== Recommended process ===
* Apply the "Preprocess" steps in your FW database.
* Locate the FLEx database (.fwdata file).
* Copy it to a temporary working directory, where these scripts are.
* Edit the .ini file to contain the needed values for the various complex form types needed.
* PromoteSubentries.ini.org contains snippets that can be used for each of the different complex form types that you have. Edit as many of these as you need and delete the rest. The shell script (next step) will create individual .ini files that can be used for iterative runs of the promotion script.
* Edit the script allhacksubentries.sh to remove any of the gawk statements that are not needed--there should be one for each complex form type you have a snippet for in PromoteSubentries.ini.org.
* Run the script allhacksubentries.sh in a Unix shell.
* This will create a new version of the FLEx database (a new .fwdata file) with the specified variants converted to subentries.
* (Alternatively, you could have just one PromoteSubentries.ini file, and edit it each time you run hackFWvariants.pl, modifying the .ini file for each different complex form type, and re-run the script. Repeat for as many different complex form types as you are dealing with.
* Copy the result back into the location where it belongs. (Keep a copy of the original version, in case something got really messed up in creating the new one.)


=== Preprocess ===

== Mark the records that need to be converted. ==
In FLex, or the imported SFM file, or perl script that builds it, put a text into each sub-entry that will be changed into the Model type of Reference
E.g. "**Complex_Form**" in the Import Residue field;  o \ve Complex_Form in the SFM file
In the script this is called **ModifyTag**. It marks all the entries that should be changed to the model

In FLex make a FW entry that looks the way you want your subentries to look. This can be a dummy entry that's deleted when you've changed the subentries. 
Somewhere in the Entry put some unique text.
	E.g., "***Model Unspecified Complex Entry***" in the Import Residue field
In the script this is called ModelTag. # It marks the lexical entry that has the model reference to another entry

In FLex, or the imported SFM file, or perl script that builds it, put a text into each sub-entry that will be changed into the Model type of Reference
	E.g. "**Complex_Form**" in the Import Residue field; \ve Complex_Form in the SFM file
In the script this is called ModifyTag. It marks all the entries that should be changed to the model

This script will find all the  Entries that contain the ModifyTag
It will convert their references to their main entries so they are same type as the Model Entry.

=== Inputs with examples (see the ini file) ===
[hackFWvariants]
modeltag="**Model Unspecified Complex Entry**"
modifytag="**Complex_Form**"
infilename=Nktest.fwdata
outfilename=Nktest.new.fwdata

=== The script: ===
If InputProject + ".lock" exists:
	exit with a error "Don't run this script while FW is running"
Read & Parse InputProject into an XML structure

Get the Owner of the ModelTag
	# Owner is the end of the trail of ownerguids until you reach a LexEntry or no more ownerguids
From the Owner 
	Get the first guid  in the EntryRefs (xpath('./EntryRefs/objsur/@guid'))
	# This is the guid of the rt that will be used as a model
	That rt is the ModelLexEntryRef
	from the ModelLexEntryRef
		save string versions of:
			val attribute of HideMinorEntry that is ('./HideMinorEntry/@val');
			val attribute of RefType, that is: ('./RefType/@val');
			ComplexEntryTypes node ("./ComplexEntryTypes");
		set modelHasAPrimaryLexeme flag if there's a PrimaryLexeme node
		set modelHasAShowComplexFormsIn flag if there's a ShowComplexFormsIn node
		# Are there other nodes to track?

ModifyList is a list of all the RTs that contain a ModifyTag
	# xpath   '//*[contains(., "//ModifyTag")//]/ancestor::rt'
foreach occurence in ModifyList:
	get the Owner of the ModifyTag
	the guid of EntryRef to modify is found at the xpath  './EntryRefs/objsur/@guid'
		i.e. the first of the list EntryRef objsurs
	If the EntryRef doesn't exist
		print error message "This LexEnt doesn't refer to any other Lexents"
		go to next List item
	In the rt of that EntryRef xpath '*//rt[@guid="//EntryRefguid//"]'
		change the val attribute of the HideMinorEntry node to the val from the Model version
		change the val attribute of the RefType node to the val from the Model version
		Create a ComplexEntryTypes node from the Model ComplexEntryTypes string
		Get the guid from the ComponentLexemes/objsur node
		If modelHasAPrimaryLexeme create a PrimaryLexeme node
		If modelHasAShowComplexFormsIn create a ShowComplexFormsIn node
		Delete the VariantEntryTypes node if it exists
	Log the Owner as having been changed.
	
Write the XML structure

===== End of Pseudocode =====


===== Other Notes: =====

You may need to install the Config::Tiny module if you get the error
	Can't locate Config/Tiny.pm in @INC (you may need to install the Config::Tiny module)
At the shell:
	cpan install Config::Tiny

The script can be run multiple times with different models and modify tags
	E.g. a second run to fix up Phrasal Verbs:
		[hackentrytypes]
		ModelTag="***Model Phrasal Verb***"
		ModifyTag="**Phrasal_Verb**"

Don't use a quote character (single or double)  in either the model tag or the modifier tag

Powershell doesn't like Unicode. If you don't don't redirect STDOUT:
At the shell:
	chcp 65001
I doubt this will work for all complex alphabets YUMV: Your Unicode may vary.

Location of FLex database:
	C:\ProgramData\SIL\FieldWorks\Projects\Nktest\Nktest.fwdata


=== Code Snippets: ===
pythonic initial stuff (see below for installing lxml)
from lxml import etree
nktree = etree.parse('./Nktest.fwdata')
def printrt( guid, tree = nktree):
	print(etree.tostring(nktree.xpath("//rt[starts-with(@guid, '" + guid + "')]")[0], pretty_print=True, encoding='unicode'))

perlish initial stuff — some of this stuff, particularly config stuff is expanded in the script
	# LibXML already included in Strawberry perl
	use 5.016;
	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use utf8;
	
	use open qw/:std :utf8/;
	use XML::LibXML; # already included in Strawberry perl
	use Config::Tiny
	my $filename = 'Nktest.fwdata';
	my $nktree = XML::LibXML->load_xml(location => $filename);
	

Pythonic xpath of ownerguid:
path = "//*[@guid='" + xguid + "']/@ownerguid"

Pythonic print the XML of the path variable:
print(etree.tostring(nktree.xpath(path)[0], pretty_print=True, encoding='unicode'))

Pythonic path of guid for entry containing dzn by itself
xguid = nktree.xpath("//rt[@class='MoStemAllomorph']/Form/AUni[text()='dzn']/../../@guid")[0]
