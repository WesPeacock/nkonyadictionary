====== Subentries Under Senses ======
Created Tuesday 01 November 2016

===== Assumptions =====
	all \se have only a single unmarked sense
	all \se entries have a \ps marker
		Well perhaps the se2lx script could import the \ps from head/sense
			Mine won't because I entered the \ps markers
			May not be worth the effort
				many complex [[\]]se are head+nom/verb/adj-izer
	all these belong to the \se not the head:
		\xv/\xe example sentences
		\bb bibliographic info
		\sc scientific name
		\n* various notes
		
	\se is terminated by \sn, \se, \dt or (\ps followed immediately by \sn)
				'\\se.*?(?=(\\sn|\\se|\\dt|\\ps[^#]*?##\\sn))'


===== Preprocessing =====
	all the assumtions should be true
	To Toolbox view \se as full entries for checking in tmp/subent.sfm:
		$ grep \\_sh in.sfm >tmp/subents.sfm && dos2unix <in.sfm |  perl -pe 's/\n*$/##/' |perl -pe 's/##\\lx/\n\\lx/g' | grep -oP '\\se.*?(?=(\\sn|\\se|\\dt|\\ps[^#]*?##\\sn))' |perl -pe 's/\\se/\\lx/g; s/##/\n/g' | unix2dos >>tmp/subents.sfm
		

===== Script Notes =====
Script se2lx promotes \se entries to \lx
	adds a \mn marker
		\mn "$head$homograph $sensenumber"
	updates \dt under head and subentry
	for all \lx entries & \_id line, call perl with -pf  options
	for just newly promoted \lx entries, call perl with -nf options


===== Tips =====
grep needs -P (perl regex) option to get non-greedy matches and lookahead

code is easier when each entry is on a separate line with lf rather than crlf
	e.g. convert \n to ## except before \lx.
			before:
				dos2unix <in.sfm |  perl -pe 's/\n*$/##/' |perl -pe 's/##\\lx/\n\\lx/g' 
			after:
				perl -pe 's/##/\n/g' | unix2dos >out.sfm

To get the \_sh from the input file put the above lines inside:
	before:
		head -n 1 <in.sfm >out.sfm &&
	after:
		change the >out.sfm to >>out.sfm
		
Sample command line for se entries that got promoted:
	head -n 1 <da-din-org.sfm >da-din-se-promoted.sfm && dos2unix <da-din-org.sfm |  perl -pe 's/\n*$/##/' |perl -pe 's/##\\lx/\n\\lx/g' |perl -nf Scripts/se2lx.pl | perl -pe 's/##/\n/g' | unix2dos >>da-din-se-promoted.sfm
	
Sample command line for all entries:
	dos2unix <da-din-org.sfm |  perl -pe 's/\n*$/##/' |perl -pe 's/##\\lx/\n\\lx/g' |perl -pf Scripts/se2lx.pl | perl -pe 's/##/\n/g' | unix2dos >>da-din-se-all.sfm


===== Postprocessing =====
Need a script to change the fwdata file properly
This may use XMLStarlet
