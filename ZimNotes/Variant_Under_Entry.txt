====== Variant Under Entry ======
Created Sunday 27 August 2017

===== Pseudocode for setting Variants to be under Entries in a FW project =====

=== Why? ===
When the FLEx SFM import process imports a variant (dialect/plural/spelliing) it creates a new entry with a reference link back to the first sense of the main entry. That link should point to the main entry.

=== Preprocess ===
The INI file contains a list of guids of the reference types. These should match the desired references.

=== The script: ===
Read the InputProject name(input/output) & variant guids from the INI file.
If InputProject + ".lock" exists:
	exit with a error "Don't run this script while FW is running"
Read & Parse InputProject into an XML structure
for each entry in a list of all the RefEntry's with Variant Entries (XPath  "//VariantEntryTypes/..")
	The guid of the target ($targetguid) is the first  XPath './ComponentLexemes/objsur/@guid'
	Skip this entry if it doesn't have a target
	The guid of the reference type is the first './VariantEntryTypes/objsur/@guid'
	  Skip this entry if its guid isn't in the list of valid reference types
	look up the target, the first XPath (//rt[@guid='$targetguid'])
	Skip this entry if the target has no owner. (already fixed or something's wrong)
	 â€” LexSense's have owners LexEntry's don't 
Set the value of the targetguid to the ownerguid of the targetguid
