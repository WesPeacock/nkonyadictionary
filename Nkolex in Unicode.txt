\nt There was a case where a farmer caught a man red-handed stealing yams from his farm. So he went to the family and complained. They said that because he had not cut him (kun) with a cutlass to mark him (dɩnka mʋ plebi) he had no proof that the accused was a thief. Therefore the family would not do anything. So the farmer has gone to the police to lodge a complaint and has said that if that is the case the next time the man comes to his farm to steal he will shoot him and if he kills him the family won't be able to say anything against him because this time they complained that he hadn't wounded him.
