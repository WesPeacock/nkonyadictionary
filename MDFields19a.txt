\shd Helps Database for MDF Marker Set
\txt Most records in this file are keyed to the two- or three-letter field marker codes,
standardized by the Multi-Dictionary Formatter (MDF) program for lexical
databases. To read about a particular field, if you know the marker, simply search
for the letter code of that marker, e.g. for the English gloss field (\ge), search for
'ge'. If a field is listed in a discussion, right-clicking on the field marker
(option-click on the Macintosh) will jump you to that marker's topic. If you don't
know the marker, read the organized grouping of markers listed in the
Introduction. You can get there by searching or by dong a right click on the green
word in the next line.
\cf     Introduction

\txt Other pertinent topics are covered as well. Look for the green text (or the cf 
Cross Reference field) To read these discussions simply search for them (or
jump to by doing a right-click) using the following labels:

\txt (This is draft version 1.9a, in preparation for "version 2" of the MDFields Helps
database. The original database was constructed by David Coward. The revisions
are being done by Karen Buseman. May 12, 2006)

\key Alternate_Hierarchy
\shd A Sense-Oriented Hierarchy
\txt The alternative hierarchy that MDF supports differs from the standard hierarchy
in its ordering of these three crucial field markers: \sn \se \ps. (The standard
hierarchy expects the order \ps \sn \se.) The alternate hierarchy's ordering can be
outlined as follows: 

\ftx    \lx lexeme
      \sn sense number
         \se subentry
            \ps part-of-speech
            \ps part-of-speech
         \se subentry
            \ps part-of-speech
            \ps part-of-speech
      \sn sense number
         \se subentry
            \ps part-of-speech
            \ps part-of-speech
         \se subentry
            \ps part-of-speech
            \ps part-of-speech

\txt The main purpose of this alternate hierarchy is to allow the user to group or base subentries on
a given sense. A simplified example of this would be:

\ftx  \lx adá
 \ge throw ; discard
 
 \sn 1
 \de throw
 
 \se mongadá
 \ps vt 
 \ge throw away ; discard
 \de throw something away; to discard

 \se iadá
 \ps vt
 \de throw something away

 \se paadá
 \mr po-adá 
 \ps vCAUS
 \de drop

 \se puadá-adá
 \mr pu-adá-adá
 \ps v
 \de throw away (thoughtlessly or irresponsibly)

 \sn 2
 \de divorce

 \se muadá
 \mr m-pu-adá
 \ps vREC
 \de divorce smb (lit. throw each other)

 \se puadá
 \mr pu-adá
 \ps vREC
 \de be divorced; separated (used for divorce and separation of man and wife)

 \sn 3
 \de defecate

 \se paadá
 \ps vCAUS
 \de defecate

\txt This example would typically print as follows (shown without the character styles
here):

\fxv    adá   throw, discard.
      1) throw.
            mongadá  vt. throw something away; to discard. 
            iadá   vt. throw something away.
            paadá  Morf: po-adá. vCAUS. drop.
            puadá-adá   v. throw away (thoughtlessly or irresponsibly).
      2) divorce.
            muadá   Morf: m-pu-adá. vREC. divorce smb (lit. throw 
                each other).
            puadá   Morf: pu-adá. vREC. be divorced; separated (used 
                for divorce and separation of man and wife). 
      3) defecate.
            paadá   vCAUS. defecate.

\txt Note that by judiciously using the definition (\de) field you can give labels to the sense
groupings. 

\txt This method of organization was urgently requested by people working in languages that were
highly polymorphemic, because this hierarchy allows them to group complex polymorphemic
lexemes together based on a sense (rather than stand alone -- as subentries do in the standard
MDF hierarchy).  

\nt Currently MDF can only support one method of organization per lexical database. Therefore you
must choose which hierarchical method will best meet your needs and use only that one
method for all lexical entries in you dictionary. Mixing methods in Shoebox and MDF can
produce inaccurate interlinear choices and browse views, as well as odd formatting in the output.

\txt To help with the decision, note that there are advantages and disadvantages to using this
alternate method:
\nwt   •    One main advantage to this structure is that you can see all the related 
        polymorphemic forms that carry a particular sense.   
\nwt   •    One disadvantage of this structure is that you do not readily see the actual 
        range of senses that a particular polymorphemic form can express.

\ftx

\key an
\shd \an  antonym
\txt This field is used to reference an antonym of the lexeme.

\txt MDF's standard printing adds the label "Ant: " to this field. 

\txt Using the \lf (lexical function) field for this is a better practice. For example,

\ftx   \an sal

\txt could be done instead as

\ftx   \lf Ant.
  \lv wrong, false

\txt The latter gives more information to the outside reader by providing a gloss.
(National and regional glosses are available also.)

\txt For more detailed information on this, see:
\cf      \sy                 synonym
\cf      \lf                   lexical function

\typ <Optional>
\txt

\key bb
\shd \bb  bibliographic reference
\txt This is used to record any bibliographic information pertinent to the lexeme. MDF adds the
label 'Read:' to this field.

\typ <Optional>

\key bw
\shd \bw  borrowed word
\txt This is for denoting a borrowed word or the source language. There is no standard way such
information should be encoded, but generally the following is most common:

\ftx  \bw Arabic

\txt Which would typically print as:

\fxv   From: Arabic.

\typ <Optional>

\key ce
\shd \ce  cross-reference (English gloss)
\txt This gives the English gloss for the vernacular lexeme referenced by the preceding \cf field. 

\txt For more information, see:
\cf      \cf          confer/cross-reference

\txt Identical national and regional language gloss fields are:
\cf      \cn and \cr

\typ <Basic>

\key cf
\shd \cf  confer/cross-reference
\txt This is a generic reference marker used to link together any two related entries in the lexicon.
For example, in Selaru, '-aswasw kaha' means 'high water mark' and needs to cross-reference
'manahma' (the entry for 'rising tide') and visa-versa.

\txt The \cf field is bundled with the \ce, \cn, and \cr gloss fields, so this example would be encoded
as:

\ftx  \cf manahma
\ftx  \ce rising tide
\ftx  \cn air naik
\ftx  \cr

\txt and would typically print in a triglot dictionary as:

\fxv   See: manahma 'rising tide' 'air naik'.
 
\txt Multiple cross reference bundles are usually concatenated with semicolons ';' as
seen in:

\ftx  \cf manahma
\ftx  \ce rising tide
\ftx  \cn air naik
\ftx  \cr
\ftx  \cf mety2
\ftx  \ce low tide
\ftx  \cn
\ftx  \cr
\ftx  \cf rean
\ftx  \ce high tide
\ftx  \cn
\ftx  \cr

\txt This would typically print in a diglot dictionary as:

\fxv   See: manahma 'rising tide'; mety2 'low tide'; 
  rean 'high tide'.

\txt (Note that actually the vernacular text is usually be printed as bold, and the '2' for
the homonym number of 'mety' as subscripted, but these can't be displayed that
way in Toolbox.)

\txt One major short coming of using the cross-reference fields (rather than the lexical function
fields) is that the semantic relationship between the two related lexemes is not made explicit.
But it is often the case that a researcher will know there is some kind of relationship between
two lexemes but is unclear as to the nature of that relationship. This is what the \cf field is
good for. And once the relationship is determined, the cross-reference information could then
be transferred to an \lf field bundle.

\txt It is not uncommon for there to be many lexemes that are interrelated. This creates a myriad
of cross-references, where each lexeme of a given type is cross-referenced to all other
lexemes of that type. Adding new entries to the group can also be very tedious. A simple
solution to this is to choose one lexeme as the focal point and have all other related lexemes
refer only to that one. That focal lexeme will then contain a listing of all other lexemes in the
group, by using either a series of \lf (lexical function) bundles, to describe the relationships
between that focal lexeme and each of the other lexemes, or by using the \tb (table) field to
make an actual list of the other lexemes and their meanings. 

\txt For more on grouping cross-references or mapping related lexemes, see:
\cf      \lf                  lexical function label
\cf      \tb                 table

\cf      \ce, \cn and \cr

\typ <Basic>

\key Character_Style_Codes
\shd Character Style Codes
\txt Character style codes can be used in any field (usually the information or discussion type
fields) to uniquely mark the specific language of the text that you are discussing. For example,
'fv:' marks the following word as vernacular text:

\ftx   \ue This usage is a bit blunt.  Most people don't say 
      this directly, rather they refer to where they are 
      going, e.g. fv:keta to refer to 'outside the village',
      but fv:-dai is used in familiar settings.

\txt Character style codes are applied only to the following word. A space or any punctuation
(except the '-') terminates the style. The style codes must be in lower case, and there must not
be any space between the colon and the following word, e.g. 
\ftx        fv:sabun       is okay
\ftx        fv: sabun      won't work (the fv: is treated as normal text)

\txt Use the underline ( _ ) character to continue the style and link together words in a phrase, e.g.

\ftx   \ue In the phrase fv:Mala_sai_desy_de? there is a sense of 
      anger or rudeness.
\txt 
MDF will format this whole phrase with the vernacular character style (the underlined
characters are converted to spaces). The question mark will not be included in the vernacular
style.

\txt Character codes should be placed with the word, inside parentheses, quotes,
brackets, etc., otherwise the opening brackets will receive the character style
along with the word.

\shd2 Basic Language and Character Codes
\ftx      fv: (font--vernacular)
\ftx      fe: (font--English)
\ftx      fn: (font--national language)
\ftx      fr: (font--regional language)

\ftx      fs: (font--standard)
\ftx      fb: (font--bold)
\ftx      fi: (font--italic)

\ftx      uc: (underline character)
\ftx      ub: (underline--bold)
\ftx      ui: (underline--italic)

\shd2 Other Character Codes
\ftx      sc: (underline a scientific name--not 
               required in the \sc field)

\txt The uc: code is able to detect which type of field it is used in. If the field is a
vernacular field uc: will underline with bold characters (following the vernacular
character style); if the field uses the national language, uc: will underline italic
characters; and if the field uses English, uc: will underline normal characters (to
follow the character style for English). If you want to specifically control the
underlining character style, use ui: and ub:.

\txt If you need to tweak your formatted dictionary or reversed finderlists and apply a character
style where you had forgotten to place a code, simply use the same character style that
MS-Word uses to format other such text (e.g. the vernacular font in MS-Word uses the
"f_vernacular" style). Just be sure to also add the missing character style code in your lexical
database too, otherwise you'll have to "tweak" the output every time.

\shd2 Explicit Font Codes
\txt To explicitly control the character style or font of any phrase, word, or part of
word, use the underlying bar codes used by MDF. For example, to underline only
a part of a word, use the |u bar code:

\ftx   \xv Aulopo|u{a} au lae weidu.

\txt The |u{} underlines the bracketed character ('a') only. Note that the curly braces
{} can contain any string of letters, numbers, spaces, or punctuation.

\txt The complete list of explicit font codes follows:
\ftx      |fv{ }      Vernacular font
\ftx      |fe{ }      English font
\ftx      |fn{ }      National font
\ftx      |fr{ }      Regional font
\ftx      |fs{ }      Standard font (for general punctuation)
\ftx      |fl{ }      The font for field labels

\ftx      |fb{ }      Bold font 
\ftx      |fi{ }      Italic font

\txt Still supported, but not encouraged, are the older ("Manuscripter") style codes.

\txt Underlining is more complex and so provides the following:
\ftx      |u{ }       General underlined character font (as shown above) 
\ftx      |uc{ }      Specific regular underlined character font 
\ftx      |ub{ }      Specific underlined, bold font 
\ftx      |ui{ }      Specific underlined, italic font

\txt To format a homonym number in a discussion field you can use the explicit code:
\ftx      |hm{ }      Homonym number font  

\txt For example:
\ftx   \ec This lexeme is now a homonym with fv:asw|hm{1} 'dog' 
      because proto *l ~ s in Selaru resulting in a loss 
      of contrast.

\nt If you choose to use these explicit style codes, you must not forget the closing brace ' } '. If you
do, the rest of the field will be considered a part of the specified font!

\nt Actually, any field marker can become a character style code and transmit its formatting 
to the data enclosed in the curly brackets. This is mostly useful for the fields mentioned
already (sc, hm) but any field code can be used.

\key cn
\shd \cn  cross-reference (national gloss)
\txt This gives the national language gloss for the vernacular lexeme referenced by the preceding
 \cf field. 

\txt For more information, see:

\typ <Basic>

\key cr
\shd \cr  cross-reference (regional gloss)
\txt This gives the regional language gloss for the vernacular lexeme referenced by the preceding 
 \cf field. MDF formats the \cr field with quotes inside square brackets.

\txt For more information, see:
\cf      \cf          confer/cross-reference

\txt Identical English and national language gloss fields are:

\key de
\shd \de  definition (English)
\txt This field is used to fully express the semantic domains of each sense of a lexeme in English.
For related information, see:
\cf      \ge          gloss (English)

\shd2 Hint 
\txt If an entry has many English glosses, none of which are vitally important to differentiate while
glossing texts, give only one gloss in the \ge field (to simplify interlinearizing) and then give all
of the glosses in the \de and \re fields. When the dictionary is formatted, the \de field will be
used and the \ge field will be discarded. Also, because there are \re fields, the \ge field will be
ignored for reversing the database. 

\txt For example, the Indonesian morpheme '-nya' means 'his' 'hers' or 'its', but for glossing '3sPOS'
may be adequate (if not preferable), but '3sPOS' is awkward for both a dictionary printout and
an entry in a reversed English finderlist. So, do something like this:

\ftx   \ge 3sPOS
\ftx   \re his ; hers ; its
\ftx   \de his, hers, its

\txt This will simplify interlinearizing by keeping Toolbox from asking which gloss ('his', 'hers', or
'its') is appropriate for each occurrence of '-nya' in a text, and yet will allow your lexical
database to be more complete in its description of the meaning or semantic domain of the
lexeme.

\key dt
\shd \dt  datestamp
\txt A Toolbox field to help you keep track of the last time you edited an entry. There need only be

\key dv
\shd \dv  definition (vernacular)
\txt This is the hardest of all fields to fill in, because it requires the researcher to explain, in the
vernacular, what the salient concepts are (i.e. the domain) that this "unit of meaning" captures
-- from a native speaker's perspective. Obviously not easy and something usually left to much
later.

\nt This field does not normally print.

\nt This is a "free-form" field.   Punctuation and capitalization should be used as needed.

\typ <Optional>

\key ee
\shd \ee  encyclopedic information (English)
\txt A field researcher has an incredible opportunity to assimilate intuitive knowledge of the
language and culture of the people with whom he/she works. This type of information is
invaluable to others who have no access to the language area (or at least no extended contact
with the language community).

\txt This knowledge is often never codified. Now Toolbox provides a simple means by which a
researcher can "put on paper" this kind of information. Once added, the lexical database
becomes more than a "dictionary" but a "knowledge-base" of the language.

\txt This field crosses over with the \de, \ue, and \oe fields, but is intended for more verbose
explanations of the lexeme (headword, subentry or sense). Basically, the researcher should use
this field to encode any additional information needed by a non-native speaker to understand
and use this lexeme properly. For example, the lexeme "hatw" (in Selaru) can be described
with the following fields:

\ftx   \de a fired, earthen, baking form used for making fv:skyerker
\ftx   \ee Often today this is replaced by a cast iron griddle, much 
      like a waffle iron, which is frequently found in the shape 
      of four hearts.

\txt MDF does not add any label to this field, but simply formats it as entered. 

\shd2 Tip
\txt Since MDF does not format or add any label to this field, you can actually use this field to
include additional information about a lexical entry which is not handled by any of the other
fields that MDF supports. You can even add your own label to this information. It's not pretty,
but it works. For example, if you wanted to create a new field to keep track of the weather (a
hypothetical example to be sure), you could enter your observations thus:

\ftx   \ee |fl{Weather: }The sun is hot with scattered showers expected.

\txt The special character code " |fl{ }" tells MDF that the data contained in the curly braces needs
to be formatted as a label. The rest of the field is treated just like a normal encyclopedic field.

\nt Note: Using the encyclopedic fields in this manner should not be a common practice, as this will
make it impossible for Shoebox or any other program to know exactly what kind of data is
contained in your encyclopedic fields. But in a pinch, it does allow for this kind of flexibility.

\key Formatting_and_Printing
\shd Formatting and Printing Your Dictionary and Finderlists

\txt So your lexicon is ready, and you want to print it. This assumes you've set up the
database to be an MDF type database . (An MDF type database not only uses the
MDF marker set but has checked the box in Database-Properties-Options labeled
"Multi-Dictionary Formatter"). 

\shd2 Specifying the Options
\txt To print  your lexicon, choose "Multi-Dictionary Formatter" from the File-Export
menu. Here you will be able to select the intended audience (either English or
national), the format (diglot, triglot, or a reversal finderlist), specify text for the
footer for each of these choices, select a filter (to limit the formatted document
to a smaller set of records), and specify whether you want Word opened
automatically (for Windows users). 

\txt This dialog box also has an Options button which will allow you to set the basic
parameters the standard MDF print feature uses to create the formatted dictionary
or finderlists. These options include selecting specific fields to include or
exclude and some basic page formatting.

\txt Clicking Export gives you a chance to specify a filename and location for the new
document. Clicking OK again starts the whole process. MDF goes through several
steps to format the document (detailed below). The final product is a Rich Text
Format (RTF) file.

\shd2 Open the RTF file in Word 
\txt If you checked "Automatically open document in word  processor", Toolbox
causes the word processor to automatically open the exported document;
otherwise you must open the RTF file yourself.      

\shd2 Finish the process of exporting from Toolbox       
\txt To make the final formatting touches, choose the menu option "Finish exporting from Shoebox"
from under the Tools menu in Word. This runs the FinishExportingFromShoebox macro in the
document template. It updates style formatting and does a few other special formatting
operations. It also saves the exported file as a Word DOC file. 

\nt      Note: Word processor programs other than Microsoft Word may not be able to use 
the Word macro, and may even require a different template than is supplied with the
standard MDF printing process.

\nt      Note: Probably the most significant thing the Finish exporting from Shoebox macro
does is to load all the pictures.

\txt If you need to change any style formatting, click on the text that needs changing,
choose Format, Style, and Modify. Make the changes needed, and remember to
check the "Add  to Template" box before you choose OK so the style changes will
be available the next time you export.

\shd2 Print it 
\txt If the document looks fine, choose File Print. 

\nt Note: Errors in the data should be corrected in Toolbox (and export again). If you correct errors 
in the Word document, they will still be there in the data when you export the next time.

that MDF will not add periods, etc. to them; they are basically formatted as you
entered them. Therefore, when using these fields, you are encouraged to use
capitalization and proper punctuation. Free-form fields may be as long as you
need, e.g. several sentences.

adds the needed punctuation to  the end of each non-free-form field.

\key ge
\shd \ge  gloss (English)
\txt This is intended for interlinear morpheme-level glossing. It is used for reversing the dictionary
if an \re field is not present (or is present but empty). It is also used as an English definition in
the printed dictionary if there is no \de field (or it is present but empty).

\txt The user may enter data either with each gloss getting its own field:

\ftx   \ge put_out
\ftx   \ge move

\txt The underline character '_' in the example glosses above is to force Toolbox to
treat the multiple word gloss 'put out' as a single gloss. When printing a
dictionary, the underlines normally will be converted to spaces. 

\txt Similarly, a dot ("period" or "full stop") can be placed between the words instead
of the underline:

\ftx   \ge put.out
\ftx   \ge move


\txt An oldere style allows you to list the glosses strung together, separated by a
semicolon with a space on either side of it (so as to be unlike any normal
punctuation):

\ftx   \ge put_out ; move

\txt Toolbox can recognize either format and when interlinearizing will give the user
the choice of both glosses in either case. The sequence ' ; ' is also converted to ', '
by MDF printing when formatting a dictionary or finderlist.

\txt The advantage of keeping your glosses in separate fields is that if you setup
Toolbox to sort on the \ge fields (to get a type of finderlist), it will sort on all of
the glosses; but if the glosses are all concatenated, Toolbox will only sort on the
first form.

useful place to store the simple explanations the researcher is given by a language assistant
concerning the meaning of the headword or lexeme. These can then be formulated into a more
exact definition and transfer to the \dv field.  It could also be used for those lexemes which can
actually be defined with short glosses. It could also serve as a subset to the information

and is simply followed by a 1, 2, or 3, etc.:

\ftx   \lx asw
\ftx   \hm 2
\ftx   \ps n
  ...
\txt     (note the lack of punctuation in the \hm field)

\key Introduction
\shd Standard Lexical Database Field Markers (for MDF)

\shd2 Introduction
\txt MDF is a set of markers designed for multi-lingual dictionaries. It was created by
Grimes and Coward and documented in, "Making Dictionaries". MDF is also a
printing (export) process. Because this printing process was built into the
Windows version of Shoebox (now Toolbox), both have spread -- each feeding the
popularity of the other. The MDF marker set is now used by linguists worldwide.
For further information on the MDF manual itself, see
\cf      The_MDF_Documentation

\txt This file is designed to be an MDF help file available in Toolbox while you work
on your lexicon. Most of the information in this file describes the standardized
MDF field markers and their contents (i.e. what kind of information the markers
mark). 

\txt To look up the description of a field marker, use the Toolbox Search command
and type the field marker code, (without the backslash  \ character), e.g. for
information on the \ps field, search for 'ps' (no quotes). 

\txt Another way to look up a marker is to click the Browse button and scroll down
the list of markers until you see what you're interested in. 

Browse is also one way
to see the titles of information available on other topics. Remember, too, that the
"aa" record contains a full list of other topics available.

\txt MDF is not perfect and does not fit everyone's needs. If you need fields that aren't
available, or if the printout is not what you want, read the following:
\cf      When_MDF_Fails_to_Meet_Your_Requirements

\shd2 Organizing the Markers
\txt One problem faced by users of MDF is that of "too many markers". The following
summary is an attempt to make the number seem less threatening.

\shd3 ... by Language
\txt A large number of markers come in sets of three or four. MDF attemps to
generalize  the need for multiple languages by recognizing four possible
languages and providing markers for them. Most of the MDF markers are two
characters long. The second character is often (not always) a language character.

\txt      _e   indicates English language markers
\txt      _n   indicates National language markers
\txt      _r   indicates Regional language markers
\txt      _v   indicates Vernacular language markers

\txt Some markers have the language assumed. So the lexeme (lx) and subentries (se)
are always vernacular language, even though they don't end with "v" (and even
though subentry ends with "e"). Some of these, like the variant (va), have related
markers (comments in this case) for the other three languages.

\shd3 ... by Function
\txt In a real sense, everything in the entry relates to the headword. But some fields
are more tightly related than others. Some are more related to the definition,
some are your personal notes on different topics, etc. This is an attempt to
organize the approximately 100 MDF markers.

\nt Note: The following does not give the order in which these fields normally 
appear in a dictionary.

\nt Note: A marker like de* means that there is a set of  language markers 
beginning with d: dv, dn, dr, de. A right click on such a marker will take 
you to the one, and the others will be listed there.

\txt If you are unsure which marker to use, first look under 'Summary_of_Fields' for
the code you want, and then search for that field marker.

\shd2 Three Types of Field Markers
\txt In this database, each field marker is describe by of the following categories:

\typ <Basic>  
\txt This marks all of the "basic" field markers. These are the field markers which will
be useful to the most people. Consider including all of the basic field markers in
your Toolbox lexical database template, so they will be inserted automatically
into each of your new records. Leaving a basic field empty is okay.

\typ <Reserved>
\txt This marks the "reserved" fields, meaning, these fields serve a crucial function in
the MDF formatting process and so should be used only if needed. These are the
 \lc, \hm, \se, and  \sn fields. Empty reserved fields should not be included in your
records, i.e. if present, they should contain data.

\typ <Optional>
\txt This marks the "optional" fields. These are the more technical fields given to
cover just about every topic. You may want to include some of these in your
database template as well. And no doubt, some of these optional fields will be of
no use to you. Like with basic fields, leaving an optional field empty is okay.

\shd2 Multiple Fields
\txt The number of occurrences of any given field is not restricted. But in printing
through the standard MDF export process, multiple occurrences of a given field
will be concatenated within a hierarchical section, e.g. with a sense, or if there is
no sense, then within a part of speech section, or subentry section, etc. Multiple
occurrences within the same record but in separate sections (sense, part of
speech, or subentry) are kept separate.

\txt To continue this discussion, jump to:

\key is
\shd \is  index  of  semantics
\txt "Beyond key terms: a lexicon useful for translation" (Rick Nivens, manuscript) discusses the
use of Louw and Nida's (1988) Greek-English semantic domain categories. While Nivens
proposes another way of doing this in his paper, it is also possible to use this \is field to catalog
lexical entries according to these semantic domains. Reversing on this field would then yield
semantically related entries (in relation to the New Testament). 

\txt One word of caution: this is an etic approach, i.e. Greek semantics will rarely line up exactly
with the vernacular domains. This field is to be a tool, and no attempt should be made to
"force-fit" lexemes into pre-defined domains. 

\txt If selected for output, MDF adds the label "Semantics: " to this field.

\txt For related fields see:
\cf      \sd        semantic domain

\txt For references see:
\cf      References

\nt This field does not normally print.

\typ <Optional>

\key lc
\shd \lc  lexical citation
\txt This should be added only if the lexical entry form is inappropriate for the printed dictionary,
and you want to substitute another form for the printed entry, e.g. you might want the entry
"lewat" printed as "léwat" if its stress pattern were not predictable.

\txt Roots are commonly used as the lexeme form in Toolbox lexical databases, but if the language
affixes prepositionally, a dictionary printed with root forms as the entry form can be very
confusing to native speakers. In this case, you could choose a consistent conjugated form (e.g.
3s-verb form) for a citation form.

\txt MDF will always replace the \lx field with the \lc field, if present, and then resort the dictionary
according to these fields. (You can choose to restrict MDF to sort the database only by the \lx
field, even for those entries with an \lc field. This restriction will not effect the \lc field though,
an \lc field will still print as the entry form for its record. Choosing to restrict MDF to the \lx
field may cause some citation forms to appear out of sequence.)

\typ <Reserved>

\key le
\shd \le  lexical function (English gloss)
\txt This is for giving the English gloss of the vernacular lexeme referenced by the lexical function.

\txt For more information, see:

\txt Related fields are:
\cf      \ln and \lr

\txt For generic cross-referencing, see:
\cf      \cf                  confer/cross-reference

\typ <Optional>

\key lf
\shd \lf  lexical function label
\txt For encoding the semantic networks of a language. The \lf field bundle includes the following
fields:
\cf      \lf             the lexical function or relationship label
\cf      \lv            vernacular lexeme referenced by that lexical function/relation
\cf      \le            English gloss of the vernacular lexeme
\cf      \ln            national gloss of the vernacular lexeme
\cf      \lr             regional gloss of the vernacular lexeme

\txt MDF supports two ways of using the \lf bundles. A typical example using the
original (mixed data) method would be:   

\ftx   \lf Syn
\ftx   \lv -dew
\ftx   \le chop on end
\ftx   \ln
\ftx   \lr

\txt (Note that empty fields are okay.) 

\txt This lexical function would be typically print as:

\fxv    Syn: -dew 'chop on end'.

\txt If the other glosses were filled in, they would be included in the printout (if a triglot dictionary
was requested). Multiple lexical function bundles are concatenated with a semicolon '; ', e.g.:

\fxv    Syn: -dew 'chop on end'; Syn: -sin 'split'.

\txt Note: In the original MDF manual and even in the revision of Chapter 2 you will
see examples in which the label and the vernacular word were both in the \lf field.
For example, \lf Syn = -dew. This approach is now strongly discouraged. The user
is strongly encouraged to use the \lv field as shown in the examples in this record.

\txt The recommended MDF method for handling lexical functions (using the \lv
field) has some distinct advantages over the old way: 
\txt    1) Since the lexical function label sits by itself in the \lf field, you can  use the
Toolbox Range Set feature to maintain consistent labeling. 
\txt    2) Using \lf and \lv fields with the sort and jump features of Toolbox is much
easier. 
\txt    3) Browsing on a database sorted by the \lv and \lf fields and displaying the \lv,   
 \lf, and \le fields will give a virtual \lv reversal view of your data -- allowing you
to see all of the lexical functions that any given lexeme has been categorized
under.
\txt    4) New Toolbox features like integrity checks, range-set building, and word lists
will not work properly on the \lf field if it contains mixed data. 
\txt    5) If the vernacular language is written in a non-Roman script, the lexeme and
lexical function label need to be in different fields since they have different
language encodings.

\key lv
\shd \lv  vernacular lexeme referenced by the lexical function
\txt This field is used in MDF for encoding the vernacular lexeme in a lexical function network.
The \lv field "points to" the vernacular lexeme (morpheme, word, or phrase) that is semantically
related to the current headword as mapped or cataloged by the label in the \lf field. An
example of its use would be:

\ftx    \lx feten            <-- the headword/lexeme
\ftx    \ps n
\ftx    \ge millet
\ftx    ...
\ftx    \lf Gen              <-- the lexical function/relationship
\ftx    \lv agat             <-- the related lexeme
\ftx    \le grain            <-- the English gloss of 'agat'
\ftx    ...

\txt In this example, 'agat' ('grain') is in a Generic relationship to 'feten' ('millet'). Note that the
lexeme 'agat' should also appear in the lexicon.

\txt For more information, see:

\txt This is the record marker in Toolbox and is the field by which the database is normally sorted.
When formatted, MDF resorts the dictionary based on this field (or the \lc field, if present).

\txt This field contains the lexeme or headword, which is commonly mono-morphemic in a Toolbox
lexical database. But such a lexeme form may not be very accessible for vernacular speakers
if printed. To provide a more readable form for vernacular speakers, use the \lc field.

\nt Since this is the record marker, it cannot be added inside any record. It is discussed here
simply  for completeness.

\key mn
\shd \mn  main entry form
\txt This is used to reference a minimal entry back to its main entry. Minimal or "minor" entries
consist of abbreviated information, e.g.:

\ftx   \lx tado
  \ps adj
  \ge calm
  \mn teduh

\txt This would typically print as:

\fxv    tado  adj. calm; See main entry: teduh.

\txt In this example, the minor entry "tado" has minimal information and contains a reference back
to the main semantically related entry "teduh". This cross-referencing is done through the \mn
field:

\ftx   \mn teduh

\txt The main entry "teduh" would be more verbose, containing all of the information normally
included in a lexical entry. The "teduh" entry would also have the field "\va tado" to reference
the variant (dialect) form.

\txt For related information, see:

\key Old_and_Changed_Markers
\shd Old and Changed Markers

\txt Within a couple years of the publication of the MDF manual in 1995, as the
number of users grew and became more widespread, there were recommendations
which modified the MDF marker set. These changes were reflected in the
modification to the MDF manual,  "MDF-ch2  revised.doc".

\txt In this database, some of the long-since un-recommended markers have been
removed from prominent display. (The MDF tables have not been changed.) In
addition, the database type distributed with the Toolbox Training Materials and the
Toolbox New Project Installer no longer includes these markers. These should all
be replaced by the paradigm markers.
\txt      \1s    \2s    \3s    \4s    \1d    \2d    \3d    \4d    \1p    \1i    \1e    \2p    \3p    \4p
\txt For example, 
\ftx    \1s yoban
\txt should be replaced by
\ftx    \pdl 1s
\ftx    \pdv yoban
\txt In this example, the label which will be used in printing is placed in the \pdl
(paradigm label) field. The paradigm form itself is placed in the \pdv (paradigm
vernacular form) field. The paradigm approach has much greater flexibility, both
in the choice of labels and in allowing glosses in other languages.

\txt In addition, the following are still included in the MDF database type file but
could be replaced by the paradigm approach.
\txt      \sg Singular form          \pl Plural form          \rd Reduplication form
\txt Similarly, these markers could use the lexical function approach.

\key Order_of_Fields
\shd Recommended Field Order

\txt The following are all of the fields in their recommended order for a lexical entry. The order
shown here assumes you are using the standard hierarchy (the alternate hierarchy only varies
in the hierarchical order of the \sn, \se, and \ps fields). For more information on the alternate
hierarchy, see:
\cf      Alternate_Hierarchy

\txt The field order shown here is nearly identical to the order in which MDF outputs
the fields when formatting your lexicon. This needs to be stressed that when MDF
formats your lexicon, the fields are rearranged to (nearly) the following order.
This is to provide a consistent field sequence to each and every lexical entry (a
much desired goal of any published work).

\txt The main differences between the recommended order given here and the order in which
MDF outputs the fields are as follows: 
\txt  1)  the \lx and \lc fields -- in the database, the \lx field must come first, 
\txt       but for printing, the citation (\lc) field is the first field out (if it exists).  
\txt  2)  the gloss and definition fields -- the gloss field prints only if there
\txt       is no definition field. 
\txt  3)  the reverse fields and the word gloss fields -- these generally do not 
\txt       print; but if you request them, they print grouped together after the 
\txt       definitions.

\txt It is recommended that you use the database template feature of Toolbox to help you maintain
a consistent ordering of your fields.

\nt Deviating from  this order (especially for the \se, \ps,  \pn, and \sn fields) could foul MDF
formatting, since these fields also serve to mark section boundaries. For more on this, see:
\cf      Sections_in_a_Lexical_Entry

\key ov
\shd \ov  only   [restrictions]   (vernacular)
\txt This field contains the vernacular description of any semantic and/or grammatical restrictions
pertinent to the lexeme or headword. This is intended for use in a monolingual dictionary, but
can be used in diglot and triglot dictionaries as well. 

\txt MDF initially adds the label "VerRestrict: " to this field. This is not changed by either the
English or national audience CC table. But you may add a rule to change this if you wish. For
more information on how to do this, see:

\key pc
\shd \pc  picture
\txt This contains either the book and page number reference of a relevant picture
(you've either sketched in a notebook or found in a picture book), or a graphics
link for a PCX file of a picture you want to include in your printed dictionary.

\txt If the field does not begin with '.G.' as in a graphics link, then the field is treated as "free-
form". The field is output near the end of an entry paragraph, and the print tables put
parentheses ( ) around the whole field (to set it off from other types of information).

\txt If the \pc field begins with a graphics link mark (.G.), then it is NOT a "free-form" field and
should follow the basic form below:

\ftx   \pc .G.sago.pcx;1.5";1";PCX

\txt The .G. marks this as a graphics link; next follows the filename of the picture; next is the width
(here 1.5") and then the height (1") and finally the graphics format (PCX). Each bit of
information is separated by a semicolon.

\txt When the dictionary is formatted, the graphics information is moved to the beginning of the
entry, subentry, or sense in which the \pc field is found. This will cause the text to flow around
the picture. Sizes much larger than 1.5"x1.5" are not recommended. In double column format
the picture is placed flush right in the column; in single column format the picture is flush right
to the right margin.

\nt This is a "free-form" field, if it is not a Graphics Link paragraph. Punctuation and capitalization
should be used as needed.

\typ <Optional>

\key pd
\shd \pd  paradigm set
\txt This is used for specifying the noun or verb class, gender, or other paradigm set that the
lexeme or headword is associated with. These classes are generally given labels or numbers to
differentiate them. It is assumed that the classes are explained elsewhere (like the introduction
to the dictionary) and all that is needed here is the class label or number, e.g.:  

\ftx  \pd 3 

\txt Mnemonic codes are actually better than numbers (since what the number represents is very
difficult to remember), e.g.:

\ftx  \pd met:vrt

\txt might refer to a "verb root which metathesizes with its subject prefix". This is much easier to
decode than "3". For consistency be sure to use Toolbox's Range Set feature on this field. For
more information, see: 
\cf      Range_Sets

\txt This would typically print as: 

\fxv    Prdm: met:vrt.

\txt To give the actual vernacular form for a paradigm (especially needed where the
paradigm is incomplete or is irregular in form), MDF provides the following

\shd \pdl  paradigm label
\txt The paradigm field (\pd) field is used to define the general paradigm set a headword  or
lexeme is associated with. But it is also useful to give the actual forms for a paradigm,
especially where a paradigm set is incomplete or irregular. For example, the third-singular
genitive marker normally possesses nouns with the form '-na', except with certain nouns,
where its form is irregular. Any noun that takes an irregular 3sGen form should be marked:

\ftx  \lx ow
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \ge jackfruit
\ftx  \gn nangka
\ftx  \pd n-fd
\ftx  \pdl 3sGEN
\ftx  \pdv owan
\ftx  \pde his/her jackfruit
\ftx  \pdn nangkanya

\txt These paradigm label fields would typically print as:

\fxv     3sGEN: owan 'his/her jackfruit' 'nangkanya'.

\txt (where the "3sGEN" is formatted as italic and the vernacular form and the glossing are
formatted with the appropriate language fonts)

\nt Note: The paradigm label (\pdl) fields can be used with or without the paradigm set (\pd) field.

\shd \pn  part of speech (national)
\txt This field is used to classify the part of speech with labels found in national language
dictionaries. Consistent labeling is important. Use Toolbox's Range Set feature for this field.

\txt MDF requires that the \pn field follow the \ps field:

\ftx  \ps n   (noun)
\ftx  \pn kb  (the national abbreviate for 'noun')

\nt If the  order is  reversed, MDF  will not  function properly.

\txt MDF will format the \pn field only if you specify that the output is for a national audience.
When a national audience is specified, the \pn field will replace the \ps field. But if there is no
 \pn field or it is empty, the \ps field will be output for the national audience as for an English
audience.

\key Printed_Field_Labels
\shd Printed Field Labels

\txt MDF adds field labels to many of the fields as it formats your lexicon for
printing.  These  labels are explicitly noted in the discussion of each of the field
markers. MDF allows for these field labels to be changed for either English or
National audiences.

\txt By default, MDF uses the following two CC tables to make the label substitutions:
\ftx    MDF_eng.cct       (for English labels)
\ftx    MDF_inz.cct       (for national (Indonesian)language labels)

\txt MDF also comes with other label tables. For example, for French and Spanish:
\ftx    MDF_frn.cct       (for French labels)
\ftx    MDF_spn.cct       (for Spanish labels)

\txt These CC tables are in the MDF folder, just under the Toolbox program folder. 

\nt For MDF to work properly, all of MDF's CC tables need to be copied to your Projects folder.
(This is the folder where you keep your project (PRJ) files, langauge (LNG) files, and database
type (TYP) files.)

\txt Try one of these "canned" CC tables first, if these won't meet your needs, you can edit them so
that they put on the exact labels that you need.

\nt These files are specified in the File-Export-MDF-Options-Audience dialog box. 

\txt To change a field label:
\ftx    1. IMPORTANT: First, using File Manager or Explorer, to copy the 
      CCT file you want to change to a new filename.
\ftx    2. Next open the new CCT file in Notepad.
\ftx    3. At the end of this file you will find a section marked as 
      "group(gLabel)"; under here are all of the field labels that
      MDF adds to the beginning of fields. The following are a few
      of the label-changing lines from one of these files:

"Ant:"            > "Lawan:"                c \an Antonym
"Read:"           > "Baca:"                 c \bb Bibliography
"From:"           > "Pinjaman:"             c \bw Borrowed word (loan)

\ftx    4. Carefully change each label in the "Lawan:" column that needs
      changing. Be careful you do NOT delete the " marks! 
\ftx    5. Save the file to the new name (be careful that Notepad doesn't
      stick on a .TXT extension on the file --if it does, rename it).
\ftx    6. Now go back to Toolbox and the MDF Export-Options-Audience box 
      to give the name of the new CC table you created.

\txt In these CC tables  there is also options for making consistent changes to your lexical function
(\lf) labels, part of speech (\ps) labels, and paradigm form (\pdl) labels. This allows you to keep
your Range Sets labels for these all in one language, but when the dictionary is printed for
another audience, the labels are changed appropriately.

\key ps
\shd \ps  part of speech
\txt This field is used to classify the part of speech for the vernacular form (not the national or
English gloss), i.e., "fat" may be an adjective in English, but that does not mean the vernacular
form can be classified as such. Consistent labeling is important. Use Toolbox's Range Set
feature for this field. For more information, see:

\key Punctuation_and_Special_Codes
\shd Punctuation
\txt Generally, leave off all punctuation at the end of bookkeeping fields and basic data fields (\hm,
 \sn, \ge, \lf, etc.). The only places where you need to include punctuation is in and at the end of
free-form (discussion type) fields (\ue, \ee, \nt, etc.). In all other data fields, final punctuation is
added by MDF automatically. For a list of free-form fields, see:
\cf      Free-form_Fields

\shd Special Codes
\txt Toolbox allows you to hard code the following special characters directly into
you lexical database (this works for both the RTF and the MDF exporting
process):
\ftx    |{tab}          Inserts a Tab character
\ftx    |{endash}       Inserts an En-dash character
\ftx    |{emdash}       Inserts an Em-dash character
\ftx    |{~}            Inserts a non-breaking space
\ftx    |{-}            Inserts an optional hyphen
\ftx    |{_}            Inserts a non-breaking hyphen

\txt For an example which uses the special code for Tab, see:

\key Range_Sets
\shd Range Sets
\txt Through the Range Set feature, Toolbox provides you with a powerful way to maintain
consistent labeling on any field where you are using a relatively small set of categorizing codes.
The most common fields for this are:
\cf      \ps            part of speech
\cf      \pn            part of speech (national)
\cf      \pd            paradigm set
\cf      \sd            semantic domain
\cf      \is              index of semantics
\cf      \th             thesaurus

\txt You are strongly encouraged to use Range Sets for these fields also:
\cf      \lf              lexical function
\cf      \pdl           paradigm form label 

\txt Here are other fields which could benefit from the Range Set feature:
\cf      \hm           homonym number
\cf      \sn            sense number
\cf      \bw           borrowed word (source of a loan word)
\cf      \es            etymology source
\cf      \so            source of data/information
\cf      \st             status of the lexical entry

\txt The easiest way to start a Range Set for a particular field, is to Right-Click on the
field marker (option-click on the Macintosh) and select the "Range Set" tab from
the Marker Properties dialog box that pops up. You can enter the labels directly
(separated by a <space>) or use the  Build Range Set feature. This will build a
Range Set on the current field marker using the contents of all occurrences of
this field in all of the currently opened databases of this type. This is a great way
to start a new Range Set on an existing database or to compile a new list at any
time of what is currently in use (to see how consistent you are being, e.g. am I
using : or _ to concatenate complex labels, did I add a new label when I already
had one that is spelled almost the same, etc.).

\nt Do not build a Range Set on a field which does not have a closed set of possible contents. 

\shd2 Changing Range Set Labels (for the \ps, \lf, and \pdl fields)
\txt MDF standard printing provides a way (for certain fields) to list English and
National Audience substitutes for each label in the Range Sets. (The purpose of
the English substitute allows users to consistently change the formatted output
labels from the labels they use in their database, e.g. one-letter codes in the
paradigm label fields could be changed to more readable abbreviations).

\nt This ability to make Range Set label substitutions is limited to the \ps, \lf, and \pdl fields. (If
more fields need to be covered, contact Toolbox@sil.org.

\fxv Note: with this feature, you no longer need to use the \pn field to output national
parts of speech. (But if you ever want to sort or browse on the national part of speech, 
you will still need to use \pn.)

\txt These Range Set label substitutions are handled by the same CC tables that change the default
MDF field labels. For more information on these CC tables, see:
\cf      Printed_Field_Labels

\txt The areas in these CC tables that need "tweaking" are the special "group" sections, e.g.
group(gPartOfSpeech), group(gParadigmLabel), etc. Be sure to follow the instructions given in
these groups carefully. It is best to include a CC rule for every label in the field's Range Set.
To make sure you don't miss any:
\ftx    1. In Toolbox, Right-click on the field marker, to go to its 
      properties sheet.
\ftx    2. Click on the "Range Sets..." button
\ftx    3. Click on "Build Range Set"
\ftx    4. Use the mouse to select all of the Range Set labels in the 
      edit window on the left.
\ftx    5. Copy them to the Clipboard (<Ctrl-C>)
\ftx    6. Open Notepad (or any text editor) and Paste in the labels
      (that is <Ctrl-V>).
\ftx    7. Now you can print the labels or save them to a file.
\ftx    8. Use Notepad (or whatever) to edit the appropriate CC table
      and add a CC rule for each label in your Range Set.

\key rd
\shd \rd  reduplication form(s)
\txt A repository for reduplication forms for later study (conceivably these forms will be moved to
subentries, etc. as more is learned about them). For example, the reduplicated form for 'yoban'
('hit') in Selaru is:

\ftx   \rd ioboban

\txt MDF adds a "Redup: " label to this form. The data is formatted as vernacular text.

\key re
\shd \re  reversal form (English)
\txt This gives the English word or phrase to be use to reverse the dictionary for an English index.
If an \re * is present, the relevant entry, subentry, or sense will be ignored (i.e. not included in
the reversed index). Like the \ge field, the data for this field can be kept each in its own field
or concatenated in one field, separated by ' ; '. 

\txt It is often the case that there are several translation equivalents for a single vernacular term.
'huma' might mean 'house', 'hut', 'shack', 'dwelling', 'lean-to', etc. Each of these equivalents
would be good to have in the reversed index, e.g.:

\ftx  \re house ; hut ; shack ; dwelling ; lean-to

\txt They could also be entered in separate \re fields. For more information on this, see:
\cf      \ge              gloss (English)

\txt The advantage of keeping them in separate fields is that if you setup Toolbox to
sort on the \re fields (to get a type of finderlist), it will sort on all of them, but if
the reversal glosses are all concatenated, Toolbox will only index on the first
form.

\nt This field does not normally print in the dictionary.

\key se
\shd \se  subentry (a polymorphemic form or a phrase)
\txt This is like the \lx field except it occurs within the record, marking the word (or phrase) as a
form derived from the root. Following this marker would be all the fields that comprise a
typical lexical entry. There can be several of these subentries within a record. Subentries can
also have multiple senses. A simple example using subentries would be:

\ftx  \lx bren
\ftx  \ps vi
\ftx  \ge play
\ftx  \ee Implies lack of focus or purpose.

\ftx  \se brenak
\ftx  \ps vt
\ftx  \ge play_s.t.
\ftx  \de play a game, or play with s.t.

\ftx  \se inabren
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \ge recreation ; entertainment

\ftx  \se rabrenak
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \ge toy
\ftx  \dt 17/Jun/92

\txt This would typically print like the following:

\fxv bren     vi. play. Implies lack of focus or purpose.
     brenak    vt. play a game, or play with s.t.
     inabren    n. recreation, entertainment.
     rabrenak n. toy.

\txt But note that the subentries in this example are far too simplistic; they lack much of the
information that should be provided for these polymorphemic lexemes (definitions, example
sentences, cross-references, notes, etc.).

\cf      Using_Subentries_or_Lexical_Entries

\shd Sections in a Lexical Entry
\shd2 (Understanding the hierarchical structure of an entry)

\txt MDF has two built-in hierarchical structures that should be flexible enough to
meet most needs. (See "Alternate_Hierarchy" for a discussion of MDF's other
hierarchy.) The field codes that mark the boundaries to lexical subsections are \lx,
 \ps (\pn), \sn, \se. Each of these sections or subsections can take a full set of field
markers (except \lc and  \hm, which should only occur at the top of the record).

\shd2 Multiple parts of speech
\txt Multiple parts of speech (\ps) are used to organize sections within an entry. A
lexeme that fills more than one syntactic slot (as a noun, verb, etc.) should not be
handled as homonyms. This is because the different syntactic functions (e.g.
'shower' (n) 'shower' (v) are still clearly related to each other in meaning.

\ftx  \lx shower
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \de a light rain
\ftx  \ps vt
\ftx  \de to bestow special things on someone

\txt MDF's standard printing function starts new \ps fields within an entry on a new
line, preceded by an em dash to show that the lexeme form has not changed but its
function has.

\fxv shower   n. a light rain.
\fxv        --  vt. to bestow special things on someone.

\shd2 Multiple Senses
\txt MDF allows sense numbers (\sn) to be used as another level of hierarchy within an entry. In
the standard hierarchy, the sense number is lower than part of speech, and so multiple senses
should be grouped under the relevant parts of speech to denote related but distinct meanings
within a particular part of speech. (See "Alternate_Hierarchy" for a discussion of MDF's other
hierarchy.) Multiple senses in each separate part of speech should start with '1' (as seen in the
following, more complete entry for 'shower'):

\ftx  \lx shower
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \sn 1
\ftx  \de a light rain
\ftx  \sn 2
\ftx  \de a man-made device for dispensing water in droplets
     on a person; used for bathing
\ftx  \sn 3
\ftx  \de an event in which gifts are given to someone; 
     as in baby showers and wedding showers

\ftx  \ps v
\ftx  \sn 1
\ftx  \de raining lightly
\ftx  \sn 2
\ftx  \de to bathe using a device which causes water to
     dispense in droplets on a persons head; usually
     done standing up
\ftx  \sn 3
\ftx  \de to bestow special things on someone

\txt This complex record would print as:

\fxv shower   n. 1)  a light  rain. 2)  a man-made  device for
         dispensing water  in droplets  on a person; used
         for bathing.  3) an  event in  which  gifts  are
         given to someone; as in baby showers and wedding
         showers.
     --  v. 1)  raining lightly.  2) to  bathe using  a
         device  which   causes  water   to  dispense  in
         droplets  on   a  persons   head;  usually  done
         standing up.  3) to  bestow  special  things  on
         someone.

\txt Some lexicographers want to make fine distinctions between subsenses. These can be handled
in MDF in the  \sn field with a, b, c, etc. subcategorization.

\ftx  \lx lexeme
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \sn 1a
\ftx  \ge gloss
\ftx  \de definition
\ftx  \sn 1b
\ftx  \ge gloss
\ftx  \de definition
\ftx  \sn 1c
\ftx  \ge gloss
\ftx  \de definition

\ftx  \sn 2
\ftx  \ge gloss
\ftx  \de definition

\ftx  \sn 3
\ftx  \ge gloss
\ftx  \de definition

\txt Which would have the general printed structure of:

\fxv lexeme   n. 1a) definition. 1b) definition. 1c) definition.
               2) definition. 3) definition.

\shd2 Using Subentries
\txt Subentries (\se) provide a further level of hierarchy. These are commonly built around
polymorphemic forms in a root-based dictionary (see the MDF field manual (Coward and
Grimes, 1995) for an extended discussion).

\ftx  \lx bren
\ftx  \ps vi
\ftx  \ge play
\ftx  \ee Implies lack of focus or purpose.

\ftx  \se brenak
\ftx  \ps vt
\ftx  \ge play_s.t.
\ftx  \de play a game, or play with s.t.

\ftx  \se inabren
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \ge recreation ; entertainment

\ftx  \se rabrenak
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \ge toy
\ftx  \dt 17/Jun/92

\txt This would print like the following:

\fxv bren     vi. play. Implies lack of focus or purpose.
     brenak    vt. play a game, or play with s.t.
     inabren    n. recreation, entertainment.
     rabrenak n. toy.

\txt A more complete example using subentries:

\ftx  \lx bersih
\ftx  \ps adj
\ftx  \sn 1
\ftx  \ge clean
\ftx  \de be clean, not dirty or messy
\ftx  \sn 2
\ftx  \ge innocent
\ftx  \de be innocent, without fault

\ftx  \se kebersihan
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \ge cleanliness

\ftx  \se membersihkan
\ftx  \ps vt

\ftx  \se pembersih
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \sn 1
\ftx  \ge cleanser
\ftx  \sn 2
\ftx  \ge janitor
\ftx  \dt 17/Jun/92

\txt Which would print as:

\fxv bersih adj. 1) be clean, not dirty or messy. 2) be innocent, 
           without fault.
    kebersihan n. cleanliness.
    membersihkan vt. 1) clean s.t. up. 2) purify, repent or
           renounce immoral actions.

\txt This is a special field used to give the singular form of the lexeme, e.g. in Selaru,
the singular form of the lexical entry 'asw' ('dog') is entered as:

\ftx   \sg askwe

\txt MDF adds a "Sg: " label to this form. The data is formatted as vernacular text.

\txt For more flexible labeling and to allow for glossing, MDF provides the following
set of paradigm fields:

\key sn

\txt Where an entry has more than one sense, this code gives the number and marks the beginning
of each sense, e.g.:

\ftx  \sn 3             (no punctuation)

\txt Generally each \sn section contains a full basic set of field markers (especially example
sentences as these help to validate the distinctions between the senses). Depending on the
hierarchy you choose, the sense number \sn is considered either below the \ps field (in the 
standard hierarchy) or is superior to all fields but the   \lx, \lc, and \hm fields (in the alternate
hierarchy).

\fxv    \st check

\txt Later you could filter the database to select only "check" records, export this filtered database
through MDF, and print the formatted output from Word. This makes it easy for a language

\key sy
\shd \sy  synonym

\txt This and the \an (antonym) field are helpful for those who want to keep track of
such information without using the \lf structure.

\txt But you are encouraged to use the \lf fields to handle "synonym" and "antonym"
cross-referencing (instead of the \sy and \an fields). This is because the \lf fields
allow for glossing of the reference, whereas \sy and \an do not. Glossing has the
advantage of giving the outside reader an idea of the meaning of a referenced
lexeme without actually having to go and look it up directly. For example, a
synonym of '-haw' ('to pound with a pestle') is '-tutu' ('to pound with a rock'). This
could be encoded in the '-haw' entry as:

\ftx   \sy -tutu

\txt And would print as:

\fxv    Syn: -tutu.

\txt But this tells the reader nothing really. Whereas if this were encoded as:

\ftx   \lf Syn
\ftx   \lv -tutu
\ftx   \le to pound with a rock

\txt This would print as:

\txt This marks the following text as unformatted. Line-breaks and hard-coded tab characters will
be retained. (Multiple spaces are also be retained, but this is only useful if you define the
"Table" font in MS-Word to be a fixed width font.) 

\txt A table, or list, of "cutting verbs" might look like this:

     |{tab}fv:-mair:|{tab}to adz wood
     |{tab}fv:-simat:|{tab}pop out or cut out coconut meat

\txt In Toolbox, the table field is marked as a "No Word Wrap" field (in the Marker-Properties
dialog box). This allows you direct control over line-breaks and spacing. Note the |{tab}
bar-code in the above example. This tells Toolbox to insert a Tab at each of these places,
when the file is formatted by MDF or exported to an RTF file. (Currently Toolbox does not
support typing the Tab character directly.)

\txt Inevitably, your tables will require some "tweaking" in MS-Word before you print the
dictionary. To do this, first convert the file to MS-Word format using MDF, and then search
for the "Table" style. After some tweaking, these could then be converted into a Word table
(with the Word menu command: Table-Convert Text to Table).

\txt Chapter 1 - Skip (specifics of installation of the original DOS version)

\txt Chapter 2 - see revised version: MDF-ch2-revised.doc. Has a description of all
MDF markers. Ignore references to "older approaches". The section on gloss vs
reversal vs definition is useful.

\txt Chapter 3 - Skip. Specifics of running the original DOS version.

\txt Chapter 4 Theory, which needs to be considered. 

\txt Chapter 5 - Read section 5.3 about categories of markers. The rest is mostly
about why to use Shoebox instead of Word, and about sorting, which is done
differently in Toolbox.

\txt Chapter 6 discusses: principles for choosing the headword, example sentences,
homonym vs different senses, semantic categories, dialect information. Note,
sometimes gives alternative ways to handle the same information. Check with a
dictionary consultant if you have doubts.  

\txt Chapter 7 Various possible lexical function relationships. Usefulness of semantic
relationships as an approach for eliciting data.

\txt Chapter 8 Lots of good theory on making good entries; good qestions to ask.
Special considerations for activities & events, states & processes, loans &
etymologies, ritual speech, etc.

\txt Chapter 9  Discussion on part of speech.

\txt Chapter 10  A dictionary is more than a list of words. Discusses preface material,

some special bookkeeping or analysis chore), you may do so without worry. As a general rule,
any field marker of three or four letters is a non-MDF field. The only exceptions to this rule
are the new paradigm fields: \pdl, \pdv, \pde, \pdn, and \pdr.

\key Using_Subentries_or_Lexical_Entries
\shd Using Subentries, Lexical Entries, and Minimal Entries

\txt A common question that all lexicographers must face when wrestling with
complex (polymorphemic) lexemes is whether to incorporate them in the lexicon
as subentries under the lexical entry of their root lexeme, or to place them in the
lexicon as independent lexical entries. This is not an easy question to answer, but
it is addressed in greater detail in Chapter 4 (section 4.6) of the MDF field
manual (Coward and Grimes, 1995). For this database, we will summarize the two
options below:

\shd2 1. Using Subentries and Minimal Entries
\txt If you want to keep all related (root and polymorphemic) lexemes together, use the subentry
method shown below (this is a simplified example): 

\ftx  \lx bren
\ftx  \ps vi
\ftx  \ge play
\ftx  \ee Implies lack of focus or purpose.

\ftx  \se brenak
\ftx  \ps vt
\ftx  \ge play_s.t.
\ftx  \de play a game, or play with s.t.

\ftx  \se inabren
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \ge recreation ; entertainment

\ftx  \se rabrenak
\ftx  \ps n
\ftx  \ge toy
\ftx  \dt 17/Jun/92

\txt This would print as:

\fxv bren     vi. play. Implies lack of focus or purpose.
     brenak    vt. play a game, or play with s.t.
     inabren    n. recreation, entertainment.
     rabrenak n. toy.

\txt This method allows you to see all of the related pieces close together. But you have to know
where to look. And this is a major problem; outsiders will not know that to find a discussion of
"inabren" they must look under "bren". To make this easier for new users, we recommend you
also make extensive use of "Minimal Entries" (essentially the same as "minor entries") -- these
are lexical entries that have only the most basic fields (maybe a \ps field and a gloss field), but
they include the \mn "main entry" field which provides the sign-post back to the lexical entry
where more information can be found.

\txt The minimal entry for "inabren" might be:
\ftx   \lx inabren
\ftx   \ps n
\ftx   \ge recreation
\ftx   \mn bren

\txt When printed the \mn field typically has the label "See main entry:". 

\txt That is all there is to this minimal entry. For this reason, it is expected that the subentry for
"inabren" would look very much like a full lexical entry; it would contain verbose definitions,
have example sentences, multiple senses (if needed), cross-referencing, and any encyclopedic
information, notes, or comments that are needed to elucidate this lexeme, i.e. it would be as
though a full lexical entry were stuck right inside another lexical entry. (The above example of
subentry use obviously falls short of this expectation -- it is merely an example.)

\txt But practically speaking, many find it difficult to actually put the same amount of effort into
embellishing a subentry as they would into a main lexical entry. For this reason, and for the fact
that such embellished records soon become enormous, you might find the alternative way
better for you:

\shd2 2. Lexical Entries and Cross-referencing
\txt The alternative is nearly the exact opposite: make all lexemes (roots or polymorphemic forms)
main lexical entries. But in order to see the relationships between the scattered pieces, you will
need to use an extensive cross-referencing system. MDF provides the \cf and the \lf field
bundles for this.

\txt Again using the above example, the "bren" lexical entry would include the following fields:

\ftx   \cf brenak
\ftx   \ce play s.t.

\ftx   \cf inabren
\ftx   \ce recreation

\ftx   \cf rabrenak
\ftx   \ce toy

\txt These \cf fields reference full lexical entries for both "inabren" and for "rabrenak". If you wish
to provide even further information regarding the relationship between the "bren" lexeme and
these referenced lexemes, use the \lf field (the \lf labels shown here are not certain):

\ftx   \lf Vgoal
\ftx   \lv brenak
\ftx   \le play s.t.

\ftx   \lf Ngoal
\ftx   \lv inabren
\ftx   \le recreation

\ftx   \lf Ninst
\ftx   \lv rabrenak
\ftx   \le toy

\txt This strategy keeps the individual records smaller and still provides a way to see
what all the related forms are and their general meanings and relationships. But
for more detailed information about a related lexeme requires searching through
the lexicon (easy  in Toolbox, but tedious when in book form).

\txt You will need to decide which strategy will work best for you.

\txt For more information on sections in a lexical entry, see:

\cf      Alternate_Hierarchy

\key uv
\shd \uv usage (vernacular)
\txt This field contains the vernacular description of common usage, or restrictions in usage, (such
as taboos), or any other information that is needed to describe the lexeme fully. This is
intended for use in a monolingual dictionary, but can be used in diglot and triglot dictionaries as
well. For more information, see:
\cf      \ue            usage (English)

\txt MDF initially adds the label "VerUsage: " to this field.  This is not changed by either the
English or national audience CC table. But you may add a rule to change this if you wish. For
more information on how to do this, see:

\txt Identical English, national and regional language fields are:

\typ <Optional>

\key va
\shd \va  variant forms
\txt This is where variant forms of the lexical entry or subentry can be noted (be they from another
dialect or minor alternation in the focus dialect, as in "do not" and "don't"). These variant forms
can (but do not have to) refer to minor or minimal entries found elsewhere in the dictionary. 

\txt The \va field heads a bundle of comment fields (\ve, \vn, \vr). These comment fields can be
used to specify the dialect name or area that uses the variant form given in the \va field. But
because they are comment fields, you may enter any comment information that you want to
appear in the dictionary with the variant form.

\txt MDF adds the label "Variant:" to the beginning of the first \va field in any given section of a
lexical entry. The comment fields are added to the variant form with parentheses, but no
additional label. Multiple variant bundles are allowed.

\txt The related comment fields are:
\cf      \ve, \vn, and \vr

\txt For information concerning minor entries, see:

\txt This topic is still under construction. Terse notes on common problems and
answers are below. Contact Toolbox@sil.org for more details or other problems.

\shd2 Typical problems
\txt appearance of the printout -- modify the template in Word, check "add to
template" to keep changes for the next export; check Page Setup under Options
for columns, margins, odd-even -- these are not included in the template

\txt labels in the wrong language -- check the set of files mdf_xxx.cct to see if the
language you want is available. if not, modify the mdf_eng.cct and save as an
appropriate name, then select that file by Modifying the Audience options.

\txt labels in the wrong script -- modify the template in Word, check "add to template"
to keep changes for the next export

\txt label needed after the field, not preceding -- contact Toolbox@sil.org. A more
flexible system is coming

\txt punctuation is not what is wanted -- punctuation is very difficult to modify.
Contact Toolbox@sil.org. A more flexible system is coming.

\txt some fields not included in the printout -- check list of markers to exclude; check
Options settings for various "include..." options; check Audience selection; check
diglot / triglot selection; check Finderlist selection

\txt sorted order of the printout -- check language encoding assignment of \lx and \lc
in MDF.typ and also in MDF_RTF.typ, which MDF printing uses for final sorting.
(Do Project, Database types in order to check MDF_RTF.typ.)

\txt fields are printed in the wrong order -- MDF standard printing reorders all fields
according to a specific pattern; a version which doesn't reorder is available.
contact Toolbox@sil.org for help on this. (Soon to be made widely available.)

\txt marker NOT to be printed, not available -- no problem, create a new marker and
use it for whatever notes or questions you are wanting it for. Also, read the NOTE
ON ADDING MARKERS at the end.

\txt marker to be printed but NOT FINAL printing, not available -- create the new
marker, check "include non-MDF field" under options and be sure it is in the list
of fields included (Select Fields to be Excluded button in Options). Note, such
fields will be printed at the end of the entry. Also, read the NOTE ON ADDING
MARKERS at the end.

\txt marker for final printing not available -- be sure you understand what *is*
available (read the descriptions of the markers). MDF standard printing puts all
non-MDF fields at the end. If that's OK, be sure it's included for printing ("Select
Fields to be Excluded" button in Options).  Also, read the NOTE ON ADDING
MARKERS at the end.

\txt need markers for more scripts than are available, multiple scripts for the same
field (eg, lexeme) --  if it's only the lexeme (perhaps entered in Roman but you
want to print in script) AND you are not using the lexical citation option (\lc
field), then the \lc field can be used for the script form of the lexeme. Similarly,
if you don't have a regional language, you can use the various regional markers to
provide another script (Actually, you may have to shuffle the meanings of the
various "languages" in order to get the order you want.) -- these tricks are not
really encouraged, but can be made to work. If these don't meet your needs,
contact Toolbox@sil.org; a more flexible system is being developed. Also, read
the NOTE ON ADDING MARKERS at the end. 

\nt NOTE ON ADDING MARKERS: 
\txt The MDF marker set is a standard recognized by various organizations. Additional
markers should not be added without good motivation. On the other hand, it is
also recognized that the marker set does not cover all possible reasonable needs.
If you are going to publish electronically or if you are going to archive your
dictionary through some organization, be sure they understand and approve the
marker set you are using. Also, include your database type file with the archive
and be sure your new markers have a good description. If you have legacy data, be
sure that the archiving or publishing organization has the appropriate font(s) and 
language encoding file(s).
